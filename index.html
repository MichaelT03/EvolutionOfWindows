                <p class="text-lg-end text-md-center text-center">
                    The first version of Windows was made by Microsoft in 1985 as a simple graphical user interface.
                    When Microsoft first announced Windows they didn't call it Windows.
                    They called it an Interface Manager in 1983, but when it was released in 1985 Microsoft changed it to Windows.
                    It was made as an extension of the disk operating system that Microsoft already had.
                    The reason it was made was to go head-to-head with the graphical user interface of Apple's.
                    Although Microsoft was late in the graphical user interfaces, 
                    they were able to sell it at a much more affordable price than its competitors.

                    They have reached 1.4 billion computers with around a 70% of all computers using windows.
                    Microsoft although as slowed down with updates to Windows, they keep updating to this day.
                    They just came out with WIndows 11, which shows that Microsoft, after 38 years is not done with Windows.

                <hr>
                <p class="text-center">
                    Windows provided many things for computers, and made the easier to use.
                    It provided many menus and buttons that you can just click intead of text commands to find certain things.
                    Windows also made multiple programs to be opened on a computer at the same time.
                    Without Windows who knows how hard a computer might be to use.
                    It is also important for everyday tasks, with how the corona virus hit the world,
                    computers became more relevant with education and at home jobs.
                    Windows helped people that had no idea what a computer was easily use them.
